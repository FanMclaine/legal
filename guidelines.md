# Miruku.cafe guidelines

1. No spamming.Spamming is the repeated uploading of the same or similar content over and over for where there is no real effort put into the content. You don't need to post 30 copies of Nezuko smiling while stomping Daki's face in.

1. Do not post NSFW or suggestive minors, including drawings; do not participate in hate speech, violent extremism; do not share malware; do not promote self-harm or suicide; do not harass users or evade blocks/bans.

1. Pray to our server admins once for every 5th note you make. This is obvious of course, but the Admins need love too!
